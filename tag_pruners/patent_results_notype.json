The invention provides a PCR primer that hybridizes under suitable PCR conditions to a polynucleotide sequence 5\u2032 in each respective strand to a mutation of an EGFR gene that encodes a substitution of threonine by methionine at position 790 of the EGFR polypeptide. The invention also provides a PCR primer hybridizes to a sequence that includes a mutant T at the position corresponding to base 2369 of EGFR cDNA but not to a second EGFR polynucleotide containing a wild type C. The invention provides several methods and kits for detecting a mutant epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene in a sample comprising probing the sample with a means for selectively detecting a nucleotide sequence comprising a mutant T at the position corresponding to base 2369 of EGFR cDNA, and identifying that the base at said position is T. These methods and kits are also useful to predict resistance to the therapeutic effects of gefitinib or erlotinib in a subject suffering from or suspected of having a cancer.",

The cipher device performs an enciphering process for each message block of data by carrying out a predetermined number of iteration operations in the first of which a first half of the message block of data bits is first expanded by duplicating predetermined ones of the data bits. The data bits of the expanded message block are combined by modulo-2 addition with an equal number of cipher key bits, selected in accordance with an arbitrary but fixed permutation, to produce a plurality of multi-bit segments forming the arguments for a plurality of different nonlinear substitution function boxes. The substitution boxes perform a plurality of nonlinear transformation functions to produce a substitution set of bits which are equal in number to the number of data bits in the first half of the message block. The substitution set of bits is then subjected to a linear transformation in accordance with an arbitrary but fixed permutation. The combined nonlinear transformation and linear transformation results in a product block cipher of the first half of the message block. The second half of the message block is then modified by modulo-2 addition with the product block cipher of the first half of the message block to produce a modified second half of the message. The modified second half of the message block then replaces the first half of the message block which at the same time replaces the second half of the message block in preparation for the next iteration operation. During the next iteration operation, the cipher key bits are shifted according to a predetermined shift schedule to provide a new set of permuted cipher key bits. The modified second half of the message block is then used with the new set of permuted cipher ket bits in a similar product block cipher operation, the result of which is used to modify the first half of the message block. The modified first half of the message block then replaces the modified second half of the message block which at the same time replaces the first half of the message block in preparation for the next iteration operation. During each of the remaining iteration operations of the enciphering process except the last, the cipher key bits are shifted according to the predetermined shift schedule, a modified half of the message block is remodified according to a product block cipher of the previously modified half of the message block and the resulting remodified half of a message block is effectively transposed with the previously modified half of the message block. During the last iteration operation, the cipher key bits are shifted a last time according to the shift schedule and a last remodification of a modified half of the message block is performed according to a product block cipher of the previously modified half of the message block but the resulting remodified half of the message block and the previously modified half of the message block are not transposed and now constitute the enciphered version of the original message block. Deciphering an enciphered message block is carried out by the same series of iteration operations under control of the same cipher key shifted during the iteration operations according to a predetermined shift schedule in a direction opposite to that in the enciphering process to reverse the enciphering process and undo every iteration that was carried out in the enciphering process to produce a resulting message block identical with the original message block.",

The harvester is of the type having a gripping means disposed adjacent the forward end of the apparatus and a shear and delimber longitudinally movable relative to the boom. The shear and delimber are initially positioned adjacent each other and during the first rearward delimbing stroke, the delimber moves rearward relative to the shear. At the end of the delimbing stroke, the shear is activated to sever a first bolt, then a greater pressure is applied to the delimber blades so that they are able to grip the remaining trunk for the return stroke, during which the delimber moves forward relative to the shear. Thus, at the end of the return stroke the delimber and shear have returned to their initial positions and the delimbed portion of the remaining trunk extends a sufficient distance forwardly of the shear to be clamped by the gripping means. The pressure on the delimbing blades is reduced to the regular delimbing pressure, and the harvester is then in a position to perform a second delimbing stroke, followed by a second return stroke, and if necessary, a third set of strokes. Thus, it is possible with the method and harvester provided herein to quickly and efficiently delimb a tree trunk of any length with only one shear and delimber assembly.",

The tool finds particular application in connection with a patented high package density island configuration wherein each IC package is secured by means of the registration hole on a retention post of a connector which is mounted between, and in close proximity to, adjacent parallel sections of the island cooling frame. The IC package heat sink member has at least one integral extension adapted to contact the frame. In performing its holding and insertion function, the tool is capable of engaging the sides of the registration hole. The assembler may then convey the IC package to the connector in which it is to be mounted, and positions the hole above the connector retention post. The application of pressure upon the tool directed substantially perpendicular to the connector, inserts the chip into the connector body and onto the retention post. The tool is then withdrawn. The entire operation requires no actual digital contact with the package by the assembler.",

The remote terminals and the host system include data security devices capable of performing a variety of cryptographic operations.

Protection is provided for the terminal master keys by enciphering them under a variant of the host master key. The terminal master keys are then written into the data security devices of the respective remote terminals to permit cryptographic operations to be performed. When a communication session is to be established between a designated remote terminal and the host system, a random number is generated and defined as an operational key enciphered under the host master key which permits the operational key to be used at the host system for enciphering or deciphering data operations. The host data security device, using the enciphered master key of the designated remote terminal, transforms the enciphered operational key under control of the host master key into a form in which the operational key is enciphered under the terminal master key of the designated remote terminal.

The host system includes a data security device which contains a secure host master key and is capable of performing a variety of cryptographic operations. At initialization time, the host system generates a series of file keys for the associated storage media and protects them by enciphering the file keys under a variant of the host master key. When a data file is to be created, a random number is generated and defined as an operational key enciphered under the file key of a designated storage media. The host data security device, using the enciphered file key of the designated storage media, transforms the enciphered operational key under control of the host master key into a form which permits the operational key to be used for enciphering host data. The operational key enciphered under the file key of the designated storage media, as header information, together with the host data enciphered under the operational key is written on the storage media as an enciphered data file. When the data file is recovered, the host data security device, using the enciphered file key of the designated storage media, transforms the enciphered operational key header information under control of the host master key into a form which permits the operational key to be used for deciphering the enciphered data file to obtain the file data in clear form.",

Pressure is then applied to the system of 1,000 psi. of nitrogen at 80.degree. C. for 2 to 12 hours. Thereafter, the temperature is increased to 110.degree. C. for 2 to 12 hours. The system is then cured at 135.degree. C. for approximately 12 to 24 hours. To minimize corona, shields are placed in selected portions of the transformer, the shields having edges formed into radii ends to avoid points at which corona would normally tend to concentrate. Also, the transformer is wound using ultra-clean components to obtain a transformer package that is free from impurities prior to impregnation.",

An active textile system for governing frictional force levels at an interface with a user or object is presented. The system includes a textile structure that is fabricated from interlaced first and second textile filaments. Each textile filament has a respective texture that exhibits a distinct coefficient of friction. The textile structure has an outer and/or upper contact surface at the interface with the user/object. An actuating element, which is connected to the textile structure, is operable to selectively transition the textile structure between first and second states. The first state includes the first textile filament defining the textile structure's outer contact surface, whereas the second state includes the second textile filament defining the outer contact surface.",

Candidate polymorphic repeats are identified by detecting tandem repeats in a target coding sequence, scoring the repeats for polymorphic probability, and generating a dataset correlating the repeats with polymorphic probability. Actual polymorphic repeat are identified by further detecting the candidate polymorphic repeat in each of a population of different coding sequences, and determining whether the candidate polymorphic repeat is polymorphic in the population. Computationally derived polymorphic repeats are validated with phenotypic variations and these correlates are used to detect the presence or absence of such phenotypic variation in test genes. Variances at polymorphic repeats are identified by detecting in a test gene or coding region the presence or absence of variance at a disclosed unconventional polymorphic repeat.",

The temperature sensitive hydrogel may also contain a drug or a therapeutic agent, for example, a pain relieving drug, for a short-term controlled release. The temperature sensitive hydrogel is in liquid state at room temperature, but upon injection, shortly becomes gelatinous. This system is particularly suitable for treatment of diseases, disorders, or conditions, for example, tumors, discogenic back pain, or arthritis, warranting localized administration of a drug or a therapeutic agent.

Study participants with moderate knee OA and knee pain will continue taking their NSAID or stop taking their NSAID and start taking acetaminophen.

Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Chemotherapy drugs, such as cisplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. This trial is being done to see if a reduced dose of radiation therapy and nivolumab works as well as standard dose radiation therapy and cisplatin in treating patients with oropharyngeal cancer.",

The usual approach for patients is treatment with FOLFOX chemotherapy. Chemotherapy drugs work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Irinotecan blocks certain enzymes needed for cell division and DNA repair, and it may kill tumor cells. Adding irinotecan to the FOLFOX regimen could shrink the cancer and extend the life of patients with advanced gastroesophageal cancers.",

Enzalutamide helps fight prostate cancer by blocking the use of testosterone by the tumor cells for growth. Poly adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors, such as rucaparib, fight prostate cancer by prevent tumor cells from repairing their DNA. Giving enzalutamide and rucaparib may make patients live longer or prevent their cancer from growing or spreading for a longer time, or both. It may also help doctors learn if a mutation in any of the homologous recombination DNA repair genes is helpful to decide which treatment is best for the patient.",

Chemotherapy drugs, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading.

The EGFR protein is involved in cell signaling pathways that control cell division and survival. Sometimes, mutations in the EGFR gene cause EGFR proteins to be made in higher than normal amounts on some types of cancer cells. This causes cancer cells to divide more rapidly. Osimertinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking EGFR that is needed for cell growth in this type of cancer. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving osimertinib with bevacizumab may control cancer for longer and help patients live longer as compared to osimertinib alone.",

The lungs are constantly exposed to environmental factors such as dust, fumes, microbes, and pollutants. But much is still not known about how these pollutants lead to respiratory illnesses. Researchers want to collect samples from lungs and blood to see how genetics and environmental pollutants affect cellular responses or functioning.\n\nObjectives:\n\nTo study how cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway enzymes affect macrophage function in the lungs and inflammatory responses.\n\nEligibility:\n\nAdults ages 18 65 who can have a bronchoscopy.\n\nDesign:\n\nAll study visits will take place at the NIEHS Clinical Research Unit in Research Triangle Park, NC.\n\nAt study visit 1, participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have blood and urine tests. They will take tests that measure their lung function. They will answer questionnaires. Before the visit, they will be given a list of medicines they cannot take. They also must not have caffeine on the day of their visit. The visit will last about 3 hours.\n\nAt study visit 2, participants will give blood samples. They will undergo bronchoscopy. For this, they will get an intravenous line in a vein to get sedatives. Their airways will be numbed. Cells will be collected from their lungs. They will fast for 8 hours before the visit. They must have someone else drive them home from the visit. The visit will last about 3-4 hours.\n\nParticipants will get a follow-up phone call about 1 day after study visit 2.",

        "abstract": "Background:\n\n- Cockroach allergies are an important risk factor for asthma in inner-city households, especially in children. A new method for killing cockroaches may help children who live in households that have high numbers of cockroaches. Because most public health treatments target more than just cockroaches, this method could lower the costs of treating childhood allergies and asthma by focusing on the most likely source of the allergy.\n\nObjectives:\n\n- To test a new cockroach-killing method designed to reduce asthma in children exposed to cockroaches.\n\nEligibility:\n\nChildren 5 to 14 years of age who have moderate to severe asthma.\nChildren must live in a household that has a high number of cockroaches.\n\nDesign:\n\nParticipants will be screened with a phone call and an initial home visit.\nStudy doctors will place cockroach traps, and return after 3 days to check the number of roaches caught and killed. Dust samples will be collected from the house.\nParticipants will have blood and lung function tests, and will be tested for allergies (including cockroach allergies).\nSome households will be treated for cockroaches at regular intervals, or more frequently if required by the study doctors.\nParticipants will have regular checkup visits in their homes at months 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 and short phone call interviews at months 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 to study their asthma symptoms. The home visits will also check the cockroach levels in the house.",

        "abstract": "The most important risk factor for asthma in inner-city homes may be exposure to cockroach allergen. In a previous study, the researchers reported that extermination alone, without resident education or professional cleaning, reduced allergen levels in inner-city homes. This result contradicted earlier findings by other scientists. This study seeks to confirm the researchers' earlier results, and to determine how intensive an effective extermination must be.\n\nThe study will last one year and include 60 infested, multi-unit rental homes in North Carolina, divided into three groups. In the Treatment-1 group, researchers from North Carolina State University will set insecticide bait in initial and follow-up visits, as the highest standard for treatment. In the Treatment-2 group, one of five commercial pest-control companies will be randomly assigned to treat each home according to a 12-month, pre-paid contract. The third group will be a control group that receives no extermination treatment. In all homes, researchers will periodically survey the residents, monitor cockroach numbers, and monitor allergen levels in dust samples. If this study is successful, it will be used to plan future asthma prevention trials.",

Dust mite allergens come from dust mites - microscopic spider-like animals that feed on house dust. Dust mites are common anywhere there is dust, such as in carpeting and beds. Some people are allergic to dust mite allergens and may develop asthma from living near them.\n\nPeople who live in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina who have a child between 5 and 15 years old with a dust mite allergy or sensitivity may be eligible for this study. Participants must plan to remain in the same house for at least 12 months from the start of the study. At least half the floor of the child's room must be carpeted.\n\nParticipants are given materials on how to reduce dust mite allergens in their home. Study staff visit participants' homes three times over a 12-month period to ask questions about the home, home cleaning habits, and participants' experiences with home test kits (see below) for measuring dust mite allergen. At each visit, staff collect dust samples from the child's bedroom, the parents' bedroom, and the living room. The dust samples are analyzed in the laboratory for dust mite allergens and the results are given to the participants at the end of the study.\n\nParticipants are also given four home test kits for measuring dust mite allergen in the home. At the first home visit, staff instruct the participants on how to use the kits and answer any questions they may have. The kits are mailed at certain times during the study for the participants to use to measure allergen and send the results to the study investigators in a pre-paid addressed envelope.\n\nA control group is given educational materials but no test kits.",

        "abstract": "We propose to conduct a scientifically valid, descriptive survey to measure the prevalence and levels of lead in dust, soil, and paint, and the prevalence and levels of various indoor allergens in floor and bedding dust in the nation's housing stock. The survey strategy is a population-based, multi-stage area probability sample designed to represent all 50 states. The survey will include approximately 1000 homes in at least 100 primary sampling units (PSU, a metropolitan area or cluster of counties). Residents of candidate participant housing units (HUs) will initially be contacted by a letter to introduce and provide a brief explanation of the study. A field interviewer will then visit each candidate HU to screen and recruit eligible units into the study. A short Screening Questionnaire will be administered to an adult HU resident and an invitation will be extended to those HUs that are eligible to participate in the study. A field data collection visit will be scheduled for the following week, at the resident's convenience. The collection visit will be conducted by two member team (including the same field interviewer that will conduct the screening/recruiting visit) and will consist of administration of an informed consent form and Data Collection Questionnaire, completion of home observation forms, collection of interior dust and exterior soil samples, and conduct of nondestructive paint lead analysis on both interior and exterior walls. Soil and dust samples will be shipped to analytical laboratories for lead and allergen analysis. Extensive survey design, procedure, and reporting details are provided in the National Survey Lead Hazards and Allergens in Housing: Protocol and Sample Design Report (Attachment A). It is anticipated that this study will provide allergen-specific data regarding: 1) housing conditions, demographic factors, and climate to facilitate evaluation of regional, ethnic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristic differences in the indoor allergen burden; 2) an estimate of indoor allergen exposure in the U.S. population; 3) baseline data that can be used to stimulate future studies which attempt to correlate allergen exposure to disease outcome. The study will yield lead hazard data to: 1) estimate the number and percent of homes with dust and soil lead levels above selected thresholds; 2) identify sources of lead in dust in housing; 3) permit future analysis of lead hazard control strategies an costs, including associated policy and regulatory guidelines.",

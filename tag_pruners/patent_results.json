        "abstract": "The present invention includes peptides derived from nucleosomal histone proteins which are useful for delaying the onset and progression of systemic lupus erythematosus (i.e. lupus or SLE). The peptides of the invention span the histone proteins (i.e. H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The invention additionally encompasses isolated nucleic acids which encode these histone peptides as well as pharmaceutical compositions which comprise one or more of a histone peptide. Further, the invention provides kits which comprise one or more histone peptides or isolated nucleic acids encoding histone peptides and an instructional material. The invention also provides methods of using these compositions and analogs of histone peptides to inhibit an immune response and associated inflammation in an animal and to treat disorders in an animal which are related to the production of autoantibodies and complications thereof, such as inflammatory diseases, autoimmune disorders, and nephritis.",

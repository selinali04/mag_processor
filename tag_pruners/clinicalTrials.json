Fluorouracil stops cells from making DNA and it may kill tumor cells. Leucovorin is used with fluorouracil to enhance the effects of the drug. Oxaliplatin works by killing, stopping, or slowing the growth of tumor cells. Some patients also receive an immunotherapy drug, nivolumab, in addition to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Immunotherapy may induce changes in body's immune system and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread.

In a previous study, the researchers reported that extermination alone, without resident education or professional cleaning, reduced allergen levels in inner-city homes. This result contradicted earlier findings by other scientists. This study seeks to confirm the researchers' earlier results, and to determine how intensive an effective extermination must be.\n\nThe study will last one year and include 60 infested, multi-unit rental homes in North Carolina, divided into three groups. In the Treatment-1 group, researchers from North Carolina State University will set insecticide bait in initial and follow-up visits, as the highest standard for treatment. In the Treatment-2 group, one of five commercial pest-control companies will be randomly assigned to treat each home according to a 12-month, pre-paid contract. The third group will be a control group that receives no extermination treatment. In all homes, researchers will periodically survey the residents, monitor cockroach numbers, and monitor allergen levels in dust samples. If this study is successful, it will be used to plan future asthma prevention trials."

                "This study will determine whether use of an in-home test kit results in decreased dust mite allergen levels in homes of children who are sensitive or allergic to dust mites. Dust mite allergens come from dust mites - microscopic spider-like animals that feed on house dust. Dust mites are common anywhere there is dust, such as in carpeting and beds. Some people are allergic to dust mite allergens and may develop asthma from living near them.\n\nPeople who live in the Research Triangle Park area of North Carolina who have a child between 5 and 15 years old with a dust mite allergy or sensitivity may be eligible for this study. Participants must plan to remain in the same house for at least 12 months from the start of the study. At least half the floor of the child's room must be carpeted.\n\nParticipants are given materials on how to reduce dust mite allergens in their home. Study staff visit participants' homes three times over a 12-month period to ask questions about the home, home cleaning habits, and participants' experiences with home test kits (see below) for measuring dust mite allergen. At each visit, staff collect dust samples from the child's bedroom, the parents' bedroom, and the living room. The dust samples are analyzed in the laboratory for dust mite allergens and the results are given to the participants at the end of the study.\n\nParticipants are also given four home test kits for measuring dust mite allergen in the home. At the first home visit, staff instruct the participants on how to use the kits and answer any questions they may have. The kits are mailed at certain times during the study for the participants to use to measure allergen and send the results to the study investigators in a pre-paid addressed envelope.\n\nA control group is given educational materials but no test kits."

                "We propose to conduct a scientifically valid, descriptive survey to measure the prevalence and levels of lead in dust, soil, and paint, and the prevalence and levels of various indoor allergens in floor and bedding dust in the nation's housing stock. The survey strategy is a population-based, multi-stage area probability sample designed to represent all 50 states. The survey will include approximately 1000 homes in at least 100 primary sampling units (PSU, a metropolitan area or cluster of counties). Residents of candidate participant housing units (HUs) will initially be contacted by a letter to introduce and provide a brief explanation of the study. A field interviewer will then visit each candidate HU to screen and recruit eligible units into the study. A short Screening Questionnaire will be administered to an adult HU resident and an invitation will be extended to those HUs that are eligible to participate in the study. A field data collection visit will be scheduled for the following week, at the resident's convenience. The collection visit will be conducted by two member team (including the same field interviewer that will conduct the screening/recruiting visit) and will consist of administration of an informed consent form and Data Collection Questionnaire, completion of home observation forms, collection of interior dust and exterior soil samples, and conduct of nondestructive paint lead analysis on both interior and exterior walls. Soil and dust samples will be shipped to analytical laboratories for lead and allergen analysis. Extensive survey design, procedure, and reporting details are provided in the National Survey Lead Hazards and Allergens in Housing: Protocol and Sample Design Report (Attachment A). It is anticipated that this study will provide allergen-specific data regarding: 1) housing conditions, demographic factors, and climate to facilitate evaluation of regional, ethnic, socioeconomic, and housing characteristic differences in the indoor allergen burden; 2) an estimate of indoor allergen exposure in the U.S. population; 3) baseline data that can be used to stimulate future studies which attempt to correlate allergen exposure to disease outcome. The study will yield lead hazard data to: 1) estimate the number and percent of homes with dust and soil lead levels above selected thresholds; 2) identify sources of lead in dust in housing; 3) permit future analysis of lead hazard control strategies an costs, including associated policy and regulatory guidelines."

Conventional practice leaves referral and testing decisions to mostly non-expert clinicians implementing complex guidelines at the point of care, leading to substantial under-utilization. The investigators hypothesize that panel-based universal screening coupled with electronic medical record- (EMR-) based algorithms can improve ascertainment of genetic risk by functioning as an automated, radically simplified default practice in place of repeated single decisions requiring clinician cognitive effort and action.\n\nA secondary goal is to explore differences in ascertainment of genetic risk among first-degree relatives of probands."

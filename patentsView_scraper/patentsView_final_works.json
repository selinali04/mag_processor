Also disclosed an X-Y imager formed on a gallium arsenide substrate from a plurality of pixels and a processing area wherein each pixel comprises a photoresponsive source (1), a gate formed from a plurality of metal fingers (7) across the source (1), a drain (4) connected to a readout line and a gate resistor (12) connected in series with the fingers (7). The arrangement of fingers (7) across the source (1) in co-operation with the gate resistor (12) produces an enhanced optical gain.",

Preferably the terahertz radiation generator forms part of the receiving window. The enclosure has a modified atmosphere to permit ready transmission of terahertz radiation. A beam splitter is positioned between the laser and the terahertz generator to split off a probe laser beam from the terahertz inducing laser radiation which is also directed to the detector means. The output from the detector being determined by the amplitude of that part of the reflected teraherz radiation wave coaligned with the probe laser at the detector. A delay is positioned in the probe laser path to altering the length of the probe laser path over terahertz subwavelength distances so that different parts of the terahertz wave form can be interrogated by the probe laser to thereby ascertain the shape and dimensions of the reflected terahertz radiation.",

The installation includes a heater element installed about the exterior lateral and top surfaces of the cabinet outer case adjacent the outer case reentrant flanges. The heater cable is housed within a protective and decorative trim channel secured to the cabinet outer case. The electrical leads for the heating element pass into the machine compartment for connections to the power supply through openings located beneath the trim channel.",

        "abstract": "A sealing grommet is utilized to form a seal for articles such as electrical wires passing through the outer case of a refrigerator cabinet, the insulation, particularly foam insulation, between the outer case and the inner liner of the cabinet, and the inner liner. The grommet includes a substantially cylindrically shaped hollow body of a relatively rigid material disposed between the inner liner and the outer wall with a core of a relatively soft material supported by the inner surface of the body and secured thereto by glue, for example. Each of the body and the core is split longitudinally to receive the electrical wires with the core having a central longitudinal passage extending therethrough for an interference fit with the electrical wires. An integral mounting flange and a plurality of spaced locking lugs cooperate to mount the body on the inner liner. A separate grommet can be utilized at the outer case with the core having a sufficient length to extend into engagement with the adjacent surface of the separate grommet so that the core has a seal with the outer case through the separate grommet having a seal with the outer case. The body could have a mounting flange, similar to the mounting flange cooperating with the inner liner, for cooperation with the outer case rather than a separate grommet being employed.",
